## Gameplay

Game starts with 3 lives and on first level.
When you get to the water "cells" you win and move to the next level.
And each level cockroaches speed grow up.
Each 5 levels you get extra life. 
When you bump into cockroach you lose life.
When no more lifes felt you loose and game starts from the begining.
You can see left lifes and your current level on the top of the game field.
Good luck!

## Udacity description
Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
